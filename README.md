# Direct-Chat-Simulator-

This Python script simulates a chat environment where random users send messages and occasionally celebrate subscription anniversaries. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

  - User List: Generates a list of users named user_1, user_2, ..., up to user_17.
  - Messages: Includes predefined entry messages and chat messages, each identified by a unique placeholder (e.g., message_1, message_4).
  - Subscriptions: Introduces a 20% probability of a user sending a subscription message, indicating how many months theyâ€™ve been subscribed.
  - Initial Simulation: Simulates the first 11 users entering the chat with random entry messages and a delay of 2 to 5 seconds between each message.
  - Chat Simulation: Continuously generates random chat messages or subscription messages, with a random delay of 1 to 4 seconds between posts.
  - Dynamic Formatting: Uses formatted strings to replace placeholders with actual data for user names, messages, and subscription durations.
This script is useful for creating realistic mock data for testing chat systems or visualizing chat dynamics.
